### The Chart builder


This example of the Chart builder has been implemented as part of the worldbank data interface, which attempts to give a good overview of where the world has been heading in the past 50 years. It's a simple interface for users who would like to focus on a particular chart. There's a list of question on the left hand side allowing the user to bring up the respective line chart. Hover and buttons allow for highlightin and line comparisons against the backdrop of the greyed out lines of all other categories (ie. countries in our case). 

The builder also allows for a split view in case we want to show for example values for men vs. women like so:


![split_bars]()


In addition to the line view, the users can switch to the data in table or heatmap form:


![heatmap_view]()
